# MEAN REST Todo

This is a Todo webapp to get myself used to working with the MEAN stack. 

I used Node and Express to create a REST API while AngularJS interacts with the RESTful API on the front end.

For later projects I plan on learning how to utilize a task runner with this (like Grunt) and how to organize my Angular code better.
